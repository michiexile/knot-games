To play Abbey - Page, you work with a selection of three randomly drawn dice faces.
The first face can be placed arbitrarily on the grid.
On each subsequent turn, place one face on the grid, next to existing faces 
and with compatible connections. Positions next to open connections are highlighted.

You win the game if you leave no open connections. 
You lose the game if you cannot make another legal move.
